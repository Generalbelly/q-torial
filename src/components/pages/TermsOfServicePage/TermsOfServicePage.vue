        Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact

        We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
        you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.<br />
